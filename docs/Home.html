<p>This class can find an alpha shape that contains a set of points known as the concave hull.<br>
<br>
It takes a set of points in a two dimensional plane and uses the alpha shape algorithm to calculate the coordinates of the edges of a shape that contains all the points in the set.<br>
<br>
Another class can render the points and the concave hull shape as an image file in the PNG format.</p>
